# ROS-project
### Course project of UC Berkeley EE106A Robotic Manipulation and Interaction
- Focusing on dynamics and grasping and manipulation. This project covers the fundamentals of kinematics, dynamics, and control of robot manipulators, robotic vision, and sensing. 
### Topics:
- lab2: ROS publishier and subscriber in python
- lab3: Compute the forward kinematics map for a robotic manipulator, and make Baxter move to simple joint position goals
- lab4: ROS webcam interfaces and OpenCV image display tools. Use NumPy to calculate homography information
- lab5: Use MoveIt to compute inverse kinematics solutions for both of Baxter’s arms, Create a visualization of Baxter’s kinematic structure, as defined in the URDF file
- lab6: Compute the rigid body transform between 2 AR tags, and make Zumy robot follow another AR tag (static and moving)
- lab7: Plan and execute paths with orientation constraints on Baxter
- lab8: Track the Zumy using a Kalman filter
